# Coding Assignment
In order to understand your programming ability better, we would love if you could complete this coding assignment. The assignment consists of building a basic CRUD application. The requirements for this application are listed below. Anything not listed in this document is fair game - we are just checking that it meets the requirements and the architecture described below.
## Requirements
For this assignment you will build a basic "Student Management" app. It should meet the following requirements.
1. When first launched, the application should display a list of all students in the database (no paging is necessary).
2. A student on the list can be deleted by the end user.  When the student is being deleted, the user should be presented with an “are you sure” dialog box.
3. A student on the list can be updated.
4. A new student can be added to the list.
## Architecture
This student management application should consist of three parts: a frontend, a backend, and a database. The frontend should be written using a modern frontend library like React, Vue, etc. The backend should expose a REST API that the frontend will call - this should be the only way that the frontend and backend communicate. The backend can be in any language you'd like. At Adzerk we use Clojure/ClojureScript for most of our codebases - if you'd like to use these for your project feel free but it is not a requirement. You may use whatever database you'd like for this assignment.
## Turning In
There is no time limit on finishing this assignment. When you have completed it, send us a link to the source on GitHub. Be sure to include instructions on how to run the application in the readme. Once you've done this, we will schedule a time to have a video chat and discuss your project.
